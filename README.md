SimDirs
=======

This started as a quick and dirty app to display the location of simulator devices and apps way back in Xcode 6. I didn't put a ton of thought into it at the time. I've recently (Spring 2022) started looking at it again. First just getting it to compile and then redesigning it to use SwiftUI and driven, mostly, by the output of `xcrun simctl`.

It's a bit of a work in progress. Perhaps eventually It'll turn into a tool with a bit more functionality. If that happens I may even write some real documentation.

That's it.
